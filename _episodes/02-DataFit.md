title: "Exercise 2: Data fit"
teaching: 30
exercises: Thursday
questions:
- "Can we perform a multiple structure fit?"
objectives:
- Perform background and signal fit
- Discuss the quality of a fit
- Evaluate the significance of a peak
keypoints:
- We need a quantitative analysis to assess the quality of a fit and the significance of a signal.
---
> ## Goal of this exercise
> The goal of this exercise is to **find structures in the JpsiJpsi spectrum and evaluate their significance**.
> `mJJDataFull6000_15000.txt` was created in Exercise 1 with a small amount of data, so the events in this file are not enough for a good fit. We have prepared [a file containing all the full Run2 available statistics](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fullrun2data/mJJDataFull6000_15000.txt) that will be used for the next fit step.

## Fit setup
~~~
cd ~/nobackup/CMSDAS2024/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/CMSSW_11_1_1/src/
cmsenv
cd ../../fitpackage/
mkdir figure/
# Then you need to compile the pre-defined fit functions
source makeLibSo.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~output
# you should see this output:

There are few `Warnings` for some library builds at the end of the print out that should be ignored.

## The background fit

We have prepared two files for you, [`null.C`](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fitpackage/null.C) and [`null_BW0.C`](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fitpackage/null_BW0.C). 

In `null.C`, only the probability distribution functions of the two backgrounds, SPS (single-parton scattering) and DPS (double-parton scattering), are used to fit the data, while `null_BW0.C` considers also one structure peak described by a Breit-Wigner. This will be described in the next section. For now let's focus on the backgrounds.

> <a href="../files/DPS.png"><img src = "../files/DPS.png" alt="DPS" width ="500"></a>
{: .solution}

> ## Task 1
> Open the [`null.C`](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fitpackage/null.C) code and understand the different parts. The comments in the code should help you identify:
> - Where the background functions are defined
> - How is the final fit function (pdf built)
> - Where the fit to the data happens
> - How to plot the fit results
{: .challenge}

Now you can run `null.C`:
~~~
root -l null.C 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It will take a few minutes to run the code and it will produce a long printout on the screen. The important informations are summarized at the end and the plot will be stored in `figure/fit_null.pdf`.

> ## Your fit should look like this
> <a href="../files/null.png"><img src = "../files/null.png" alt="background fit" width ="500"></a>
{: .solution}

> ## Questions 
> - Is it a good fit? 
> - What is the value of the log-Likelihood of the fit? 
> - How many free parameters are in the fit?
{: .challenge}

> ## Tip
> remember the *"FCN value"*! We will call it `FCN_null` later.

## The signal fit

How can we improve the fit? We have prepared a script, [`null_BW0.C`](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fitpackage/null_BW0.C) ,in which we also added a Breit-Wigner (BW) function to describe the peak at the lowest edge of the mass distribution. This is very similar to the script with only the background fit so you should be able to locate the same parts as before.

Here is the formula of the BW function:
<a href="../files/BW.png"><img src = "../files/BW.png" alt="SPS" width ="500"></a>

The BW function is often used to model resonances (unstable particles) in high-energy physics.
The most important parameters are:
- The mass `m_0` (i.e. the peak position) 
- The width of the peak `Gamma`

> ## Task 2
> Compare this formula with the code implementation.
> - Can you find where the BW is defined?
> - What is the initial fit value assigned to the mass and the width?
> - Which parameters are fixed and which are left floating during the fit?
{: .challenge}

Now you can run `null_BW0.C`:
~~~
root -l null_BW0.C 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Also in this case it will take a few minutes to run the code and it will produce a long printout on the screen. The important informations are summarized at the end and the plot will be stored in `figure/fit_null_BW0.pdf`.

> ## Your fit should look like this
> <a href="../files/BW0.png"><img src = "../files/BW0.png" alt="BW0 fit" width ="500"></a>
{: .solution}

> ## Questions 
> - Has the fit improved? 
> - What is the value of the log-Likelihood of the fit? 
> - How many free parameters are in the fit?
{: .challenge}

> ## Task 3
> To have an easier calculation of the peak significance later we suggest repeating the fit fixing the value of the peak mass and width. How many free parameters are now in the fit?
{: .challenge}

> ## Tip
> remember the *"FCN value"*! We will call it `FCN_BW0` later.

## The peak significance calculation
For simplicity, we will evaluate the local significance of the peak without systematic uncertainties. We use the null hypothesis and signal hypothesis to fit the data. From each of them we obtained the log-Likelihood `−lnL` (NLL). We called them `FCN_null` and `FCN_BW0` earlier as that is the nomenclature used by the `RooFit` tool used for the fit. 

You can read more about this calculation based on [Wilks'theorem here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wilks'_theorem). The theorem says that as the sample size approaches infinity, the distribution of the test statistic −2log(Λ) asymptotically approaches the chi-squared (chi2) distribution under the null hypothesis H_0 (`null` in our case). Here, Λ denotes the likelihood ratio, and the chi2 distribution has degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of Θ and Θ_0, where Θ
is the full parameter space and Θ_0 is the subset of the parameter space associated with H_0. This result means that for large samples and a great variety of hypotheses, a practitioner can compute the likelihood ratio Λ for the data and compare -2log(Λ) = -2log(`FCN_null`/`FCN_BW0`) = -2( log(`FCN_null`)- log(`FCN_BW0`)) to the chi2 value corresponding to a desired statistical significance as an approximate statistical test.

Using the difference `∆NLL = FCN_null - FCN_BW0` and considering the fact that the difference in degrees of freedom is 1, we can evaluate the significance of BW0 as `sqrt(2*∆NLL)`.

> What do you obtain for the significance?

## Finding all the structures
There are still a few peaks in the plots that have not been identified. 

> ## Task 4
> Try to fit all the peaks adding the corresponding BW in the code. Use the implementation of the BW0 as an example.

Below we provide some hints on how to do it for one of the peaks.

> > ## More about the data
> > If you are able to identify all peaks and implement all the BW you should obtain a plot similar to the one you would obtain with [`nointerf_nofd.C`](https://github.com/IreneZoi/DAS2024JpsiJpsi/blob/exercise/fitpackage/nointerf_nofd.C). As the name of the scripts suggest, it still does not include interference terms. Below are the pdfs w/o interference terms:
